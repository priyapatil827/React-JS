📁 src/
├── 📄 App.jsx         # Renders all quote cards using map
├── 📄 Data.js         # Array of 30 quote objects
├── 📄 Quote.jsx       # Quote card component
├── 📄 Quote.css       # Styling for quote cards


## 📌 How It Works
The Data.js file exports an array of quote objects.

The App.jsx file maps over this data and renders each one using the Quote component.
